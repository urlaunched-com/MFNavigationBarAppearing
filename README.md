"the app is developed by [You are launched](https://www.urlaunched.com)"

## Requirements
* Xcode 10+
* iOS 9.0+
* Swift 4.2

## Example

Open and run the **MFNavigationBarAppearing.xcodeproj** in Xcode to see example

## Installation

### CocoaPods

``` ruby
source "https://github.com/Molfar-io/MFPodSpecs.git"

pod 'MFNavigationBarAppearing'
```

### Manual

Add MFNavigationBarAppearing/**Code** folder into your project.

## Usage

First of all you need to setup **content insets** of your scroll view 

![Content insets](https://github.com/Molfar-io/MFNavigationBarAppearing/blob/master/content_insets.png)

### Important 
You need to use **`MFNavigationBarAppearingController`** instead of UINavigationContoller for presenting your UIViewController. This UIViewController should implement **`MFNavigationBarAppearer`** protocol

```swift
let navigationController = MFNavigationBarAppearingController(rootViewController: UIViewController<MFNavigationBarAppearer>())
present(navigationController, animated: true, completion: nil)
```

Next step is implement **`MFNavigationBarAppearer`** protocol in your **`UIViewController`**:

```swift
import MFNavigationBarAppearing

//MARK: - MFNavigationBarAppearer
extension UIViewController: MFNavigationBarAppearer {
    
    var appearingScrollView: UIScrollView? {
        return scrollView
    }

    var navigationBarStartAppearingOffset: CGFloat {
        return collectionViewContainer.frame.height - collectionViewBottomSpacing
    }
    
    var navigationBarEndAppearingOffset: CGFloat? {
        return collectionViewContainer.frame.height
    }
    
    var appearingTitle: String? {
        return place.title?.uppercased()
    }
    
    var appearingTitleStartOffsetAfterAppearingNavBar: CGFloat? {
        return collectionViewContainer.frame.height + titleLabelTopSpacing
    }
    
    var appearingTitleEndOffsetAfterAppearingNavBar: CGFloat? {
        return collectionViewContainer.frame.height + placeTitleLabel.frame.height
    }
}
```

#### appearingScrollView
It's **UIScrollView** which we will use to handle content offset for calculating appearing state of the navigation bar.

#### navigationBarStartAppearingOffset
The offset from the top of the screen, when you need to start navigation bar appearing.

#### navigationBarEndAppearingOffset (Optional)
The offset when navigation bar appearing should end. If the value is not provided, it will be calculated depending on the height of the navigation bar.

#### appearingTitle (Optional)
The title that will be appearing interactively.

#### appearingTitleStartOffsetAfterAppearingNavBar (Optional)
The offset (delay in pixels) befor starting title appearing. 0 by default.

#### appearingTitleEndOffsetAfterAppearingNavBar (Optional)
The offset when navigation bar appearing should be finish. By default title will be appeared together with navigation bar.
